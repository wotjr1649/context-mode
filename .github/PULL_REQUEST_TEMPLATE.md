<summary><strong>Cross-platform notes</strong></summary>

Our CI runs on **Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows**.

- If touching file paths, verify forward-slash normalization on Windows
- If touching hook paths, verify no backslash separators
- Use `path.join()` / `path.resolve()`, never hardcode `/` separators
- Use event-based stdin reading — `readFileSync(0)` breaks on Windows
- Use `os.tmpdir()`, never hardcode `/tmp`
